See the plan for this repo [here](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/1688#issuecomment-424888143).

To run:

```
npm i
node index.js
```

Clone chrome-timeline, build it and copy the `lib/` dir to `node_modules/chrome-timeline/` (we need to public chrome-timeline to npm to work around this).

Change the URL and command in index.js if not running on Windows.
